  "summary": "I love programming and technology! Aside from my industrial experience, I once ran my own software development business, JAStudio Technology (https://jastudio-tech.com/), for around four years. I have a strong background in full-stack software development and machine learning, with experience in training AI models for industrial defect detection and developing software systems. These projects required me to apply software architectural patterns like MVC and object-oriented design patterns such as the Factory Method. For me, a career is a life ambition, and together, we can achieve remarkable milestones.",
